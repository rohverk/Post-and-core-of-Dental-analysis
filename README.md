The  structure was analysed with an  material Titanium Alloy and a new material Sheep Horn. Input force of 250N was applied on the crown of the structure to check the following stress, strain and deformation. On further simulation the stress on Titanium Alloy was found to be more than Sheep horn. So further the tests were carried on Sheep horn.
